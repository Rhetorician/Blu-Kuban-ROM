<div align="center"><strong>SPRINT ID TERMS of SERVICE</strong></div>
<p>1. Introduction</p>
<p>
    1.1 Sprint ID is owned and operated by Sprint/United Management Company.
    Your use of Sprint ID is governed by a legal agreement between you and
    Sprint or a third (3rd) party ID provider’s term of use including these
    Sprint ID Terms of Service (“Terms of Service”). Download and use of any
    Sprint ID or 3rd party ID packs is subject to Sprint's Acceptable Use Policy
    and Visitor Agreement, General Terms and Conditions of Service, and these
    Sprint ID Terms of Service. These Terms of Service shall take precedence in
    the event of a conflict, to the extent of such conflict and only with
    respect to Sprint ID.
</p><p>
    1.2 You may use Sprint ID to browse, locate, and download Products (defined
    as data files, applications, written text, mobile device software, music,
    audio files or other sounds, photographs, videos or other images) for your
    Android-powered mobile device (“Device”). Some of these Products may be
    offered by Sprint while others may be made available by third-parties not
    affiliated with Sprint. You agree that Sprint is not responsible for any
    Product that originates from a source other than Sprint. Additionally, some
    Products may be made available to you at no charge while other Products may
    be purchased for a fee. You agree that you are solely responsible for all
    fees associated with purchases made on your Device.
</p><p>
    1.3 You accept these Terms of Service by either (1) clicking to agree or
    accept where these options are presented to you, or (2) actually using the
    Sprint ID application.

    are between 13 and 18 years of age, you must have your parent or legal
    guardian’s permission to use Sprint ID.
</p><p>
    1.5 Access to and downloading of ID packs is not included with any other
    Sprint service, including Sprint data services. Data charges may apply to
    download of ID packs. Your bill will not separately identify the number of
    kilobytes attributable to your use of specific sites, sessions or services
    used. You will be charged for ID packs at the rates and charges specified at
    the time of access or download, in addition to any data usage charges you
    may incur while connected to the Sprint network. You will be charged for
    partial and interrupted data downloads or other use, including data that is
    resent, and for unsuccessful attempts to reach websites and use other
    applications and services, including those resulting from dropped network
    connections. We may impose a monetary or other limit on use of ID pack
    charges that you will be allowed to incur in a specific timeframe (month,
    week, day or other time period). We may suspend your use of ID packs without
    prior consent or notice if we have reason to suspect fraudulent or
    unauthorized use of your ID packs, but we make no assurances that we will
    suspend your account under these circumstances. ID packs may be discontinued
    or cancelled at any time, without notice. We may provide notice of
    discontinuation or cancellation of ID packs by standard notification
    methods, text message or other electronic notification to your device.
