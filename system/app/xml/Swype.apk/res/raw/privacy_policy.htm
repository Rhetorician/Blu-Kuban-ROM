<h1><strong><strong>SWYPE INC. - Privacy Policy</strong></strong></h1>

 
	<p><strong>Swype, Inc. ("Swype", "we" or "us") collects certain data points in association with the Swype software, the Swype website, and any communications with Swype. The information we collect is used to improve the quality of our software, website, and services.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Swype Software data collection</strong></p>
<p>The Swype text input solution software that is downloaded or pre-installed on mobile handsets may collect, retrieve and/or store any information as needed for the following explicit uses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Activation Information
		<ul>
			<li><b>What is this:</b> This is a set of information from the device that enables Swype to know that a new unique instance of Swype is being activated.</li>
			<li><b>How do we do this:</b> Swype collects very basic device information such as make, model, cellular ESN, etc to uniquely identify the device. We do not collect any personally identifiable information off of the device. Swype does not share any of the activation information with third parties except when required by law.</li>
			<li><b>Cellular ESN:</b> Differentiating between a software reinstallation and a new, unique hardware installation requires a reliable, unique hardware identifier. The ESN is the only reliable unique hardware identifier that survives a device reset. Other hardware identifiers (MAC address, serial number) either do not survive a complete device reset, or are easily modified.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Quality Measurement
		<ul>
			<li><b>What is this:</b> Swype measures the quality of the Swype client to make sure that it performs to our best standards. To do this Swype collects & transmits measurement data to identify errors and areas of improvements.</li>
			<li><b>How do we do this:</b> Swype may collect the following measurement data: Speed of text entry, how often words are added/removed from the Personal Dictionary (Note: We do not collect the actual words added/removed, just how often words are added and removed), and language selection. None of the measurements we collect are personally identifiable, and any measurements we collect are done efficiently to minimize transmitted data.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
